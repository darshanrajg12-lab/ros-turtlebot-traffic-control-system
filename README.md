# ROS TurtleBot3 Simulation and Density-Based Traffic Control System

This repository presents two implementations demonstrating concepts from robotics simulation and embedded systems.

• TurtleBot3 simulation using **ROS Noetic and Gazebo**  
• Density-based traffic signal control using **Arduino and ultrasonic sensing**

The project explores how sensor-driven automation can be applied to robotic navigation and intelligent traffic management systems.

## ROS TurtleBot3 Simulation

The simulation demonstrates autonomous robot navigation using ROS and Gazebo. Laser scan data from the robot is processed to detect obstacles and generate velocity commands.

### Running the Simulation

Launch the Gazebo environment:

```
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
```

Run the control node:

```
rosrun turtlebot3_simulation turtlebot3_drive
```

## Density-Based Traffic Control System

This embedded system dynamically adjusts traffic signal timing based on vehicle detection using an ultrasonic sensor.

Two implementations are included:

**traffic_signal_basic.ino**

Basic traffic signal system with a seven-segment countdown display.

**density_based_traffic_control.ino**

Enhanced system that detects vehicles using an ultrasonic sensor and adjusts green signal duration accordingly.
